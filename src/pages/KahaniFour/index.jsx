              Right outside the mosque that shouldn’t exist, in the midst of the
              Hazuri Bagh, stands a<br />
              pretty marble pavilion. Beyond being known as the Sikh Maharaja
              Ranjit Singh’s
              <br />
              baradari, it doesn’t usually evoke much interest among passersby.
              After all, it stands in
              <br />
              the shadow of the Badshahi Mosque. But this pavilion was
              constructed to celebrate the
              <br />
              acquisition of the world-famed Koh-i-Noor diamond which, according
              to ancient Sanskrit
              <br />
              scriptures, brings misfortune upon its possessor, unless the
              bearer is either God or a<br />
              woman. The way in which this diamond came into the Maharaja’s
              hands, and led to the
              <br />
              building of the baradari, is the tale we will now tell.
              <br />
              Before it became Ranjit Singh’s possession, the Koh-i-Noor was the
              greatest treasure of
              <br />
              the Afghan King Shah Shuja. When he was overthrown by his brother
              Shah Mehmud,
              <br />
              he fled and took refuge in Lahore, seeking the assistance of
              Ranjit Singh in order to
              <br />
              reclaim his lost kingdom. The astute Maharaja agreed on the
              condition that the Koh-i-
              <br />
              Noor be handed over to him. Shah Shuja was duly placed in the
              state guest house, the
              <br />
              Mubarak Haveli, and carefully watched. Day after day, negotiations
              were carried out and
              <br />
              envoys sent over to obtain the diamond. When all efforts failed
              and the Maharaja’s
              <br />
              patience began to wear thin, Shah Shuja finally agreed to hand
              over the diamond on the
              <br />
              condition that Ranjit Singh come and take it from him in person.
              The meeting ensued
              <br />
              and Shah Shuja had no choice but to make good his promise. After a
              long silence, he
              <br />
              finally handed over the Koh-i-Noor with a heavy heart. The
              victorious Maharaja held it in
              <br />
              his hands, inspected it with a gleam in his eyes and asked Shah
              Shuja as to what was
              <br />
              the price of the diamond. Centuries ago, the Mughal King Babur had
              estimated its value
              <br />
              as being equal to half the daily expenses of the world. It was
              this question that Ranjit
              <br />
              Singh asked of the disposed Shuja: “What is the Koh-i-Noor worth?”
              <br />
              To the Maharaja’s surprise, he answered: ‘A laathi’ (a cane).
              Taken aback, the Maharaja
              <br />
              asked Shuja what he meant and he replied: “You are taking this
              diamond from me by
              <br />
              the force of a laathi (forcefully). Know that there will come a
              power after me which will
              <br />
              take the diamond from you through the force of a laathi as well.”
              <br />
              Having given this bold answer to none other than Ranjit Singh
              himself, and having now
              <br />
              given him what he wanted, the dethroned king feared for his life.
              Conspiring with the
              <br />
              guards at the Mubarak Haveli, he escaped by breaking a hole in the
              wall one night. But
              <br />
              to his dismay, the bribed security guards at the gate he was
              supposed to escape from
              <br />
              had been changed overnight, thus ruining the plan he and his
              co-conspirators had
              <br />
              hatched.
              <br />
              Shuja was left with no choice but to escape from the malodorous
              Mori Gate, which
              <br />
              served as the drain for all the city’s waste and sewage. He
              emerged spluttering on the
              <br />
              other side, covered from head to toe in the excrement of Lahore.
              From there he went to
              <br />
              Data Darbar, where he took a welcome bath and found a change of
              clothes. Before
              <br />
              making good his escape, he stared back at the city where he had
              been deprived of his
              <br />
              greatest possession and said:
              <br />
              Lahori, lush push bohti, mohabbat thori; vikhavan booa, langawan
              mori
              <br />
              (Lahoris, big on promises, short on sincerity, will promise the
              door but make you pass
              <br />
              through a hole)
              <br />
              Later, his comments about the laathi were to prove prophetic as
              the Koh-i-Noor fell into
              <br />
              the hands of another set of conquerors: the British.
              <br />
              For all its brilliance, the diamond was a very small part of the
              treasure looted from Ranjit
              <br />
              Singh’s Toshakhana by the British when they took over Punjab. Few
              know that the
              <br />
              ‘Coronation Necklace’ which traditionally adorns the Queen of
              England’s neckline was
              <br />
              made from jewels taken from Lahore. At 161 carat, it stood as the
              world’s most
              <br />
              expensive necklace when made for Queen Victoria in 1856. Its main
              pendant stone, at
              <br />
              22.5 carats, is still known as the ‘Lahore Diamond’. Also made for
              the Queen were
              <br />
              earrings from the Timur Ruby necklace which was also taken from
              the Lahore Durbar.
              <br />
              To date, the list of the entire treasure is kept in a secret
              manual by jewellers of the royal
              <br />
              family and its contents are not shared with anyone. Estimating its
              extent is a<br />
              monumental task but historian Carl Steinbeck, while taking stock
              of it, wrote that ‘it was
              <br />
              doubtful whether any royal family in Europe had so many jewels as
              the court of Lahore’.
              <br />
              So whenever the Queen of United Kingdom steps out in her
              bejewelled majesty, you
              <br />
              can afford a private grin for you now know exactly where her royal
              jewellery came from.
